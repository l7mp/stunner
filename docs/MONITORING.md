# Monitoring

STUNner can export various statistics into an external timeseries database like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). This allows one to observe the state of the STUNner media gateway instances, like CPU or memory use or the amount of data received and sent in quasi-real-time. These statistics can then be presented to the operator in a monitoring dashboard using, e.g., [Grafana](https://grafana.com).

## Configuration

Metrics collection is *not* enabled by default. To enable it, set the `enableMetricsEndpoint` field to true in the [Dataplane](GATEWAY.md#dataplane) template. This will configure the `stunnerd` dataplane pods to expose a HTTP metrics endpoint at port 8080 that Prometheus can scrape for metrics.

## Metrics

STUNner exports two types of metrics: the *Go collector metrics* describe the state of the Go runtime, while the *Connection statistics* expose traffic monitoring data.

### Go collector metrics

Each STUNner gateway instance exports a number of standard metrics that describe the state of the current Go process. Some notable metrics as listed below, see more in the [documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang).

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `process_cpu_seconds_total` | Total user and system CPU time spent in seconds.|
| `go_memstats_alloc_bytes` | Number of bytes allocated and still in use. |
| `go_goroutines` | Number of goroutines that currently exist. |
| `go_threads`  | Number of OS threads created. |
| `process_open_fds` | Number of open file descriptors.|
| `process_virtual_memory_bytes` | Virtual memory size in bytes. |

### Connection statistics

STUNner provides deep visibility into the amount of traffic sent and received on each listener (downstream connections) and cluster (upstream connections). The particular metrics are as follows.

| Metric | Description | Type | Labels |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stunner_listener_connections` | Number of *active* downstream connections at a listener. | gauge | `name=<listener-name>` |
| `stunner_listener_connections_total` | Number of downstream connections at a listener. | counter | `name=<listener-name>` |
| `stunner_listener_packets_total` | Number of datagrams sent or received at a listener. Unreliable for listeners running on a connection-oriented transport protocol (TCP/TLS).  | counter | `direction=<rx\|tx>`, `name=<listener-name>`|
| `stunner_listener_bytes_total` | Number of bytes sent or received at a listener. | counter | `direction=<rx\|tx>`, `name=<listener-name>` |
| `stunner_cluster_packets_total` | Number of datagrams sent to backends or received from backends of a cluster.  Unreliable for clusters running on a connection-oriented transport protocol (TCP/TLS).| counter | `direction=<rx\|tx>`, `name=<cluster-name>` |
| `stunner_cluster_bytes_total` | Number of bytes sent to backends or received from backends of a cluster. | counter | `direction=<rx\|tx>`, `name=<cluster-name>` |

## Integration with Prometheus and Grafana

Collection and visualization of STUNner relies on Prometheus and Grafana services. The STUNer helm repository provides a way to [install](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-helm#monitoring) a ready-to-use Prometheus and Grafana stack. In addition, metrics visualization requires [user input](#configuration) on configuring the plots; see below.

### Installation

A full-fledged Prometheus+Grafana helm chart is available in the [STUNner helm repo](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-helm#monitoring). To use this chart, the installation steps involve enabling monitoring in STUNner, and installing the Prometheus+Grafana stack with helm.

1. Install STUNner with Prometheus support:

   ```console
   helm install stunner stunner/stunner --create-namespace --namespace=stunner --set stunner.deployment.monitoring.enabled=true
   ```

2. Configure STUNner to expose the metrics.

3. Install the Prometheus+Grafana stack with a helm chart. 

   The below creates a ready-to-use Prometheus+Grafana stack in the `monitoring` namespace: Prometheus, along with the prometheus-operator, is installed for metrics scarping, Grafana is set up for visualization, and the Prometheus is configured as a datasource for Grafana.

```console
helm repo add stunner https://l7mp.io/stunner
helm repo update
helm install prometheus stunner/stunner-prometheus
```

### Configuration

The helm chart deploys a ready-to-use Prometheus and Grafana stack, but leaves the Grafana dashboard empty to let the user pick metrics and configure their visualization. An interactive way to visualize STUNner metrics is to use the Grafana dashboard.

To open the Grafana dashboard navigate a web browser to `grafana` NodePort service IP and port 80. The default username is **admin** with the password **admin**. At the first login you can change the password or leave as it is (use the *Skip* button).

As an example, let us plot the STUNner metric `stunner_listener_connections`. First step is to create a new panel, then to configure the plot parameters.

Click on *Add panel* (1), then *Add a new panel* (2):

![Grafana Add New Panel](img/grafana-add-panel-dashboard_0.png)

The *Add a new panel* will open the panel configuration. The configuration steps are the following.

1. Set the datasource: **prometheus**.
2. Choose a metric. In this example, this is the `stunner_listener_connections`.
3. Click on *Run queries* (this will update the figure).
4. Fine-tune plot parameters. For example, set the title.
5. Click *Apply*.

![Grafana Panel Configuration](img/grafana-add-panel-config_0.png)

The expected outcome is a new panel on the dashboard showing the `stunner_listener_connections` metric.

Below is an example dashboard with data collected from the [simple-tunnel](examples/simple-tunnel/README.md) example:

### Troubleshooting

Prometheus and Grafana both provide a dashboard to troubleshoot a running system, and to check the flow of metrics from STUNner to Prometheus, and from Prometheus to Grafana.

The Prometheus dashboard is available as the `prometheus` NodePort service (use the node IP and node port to connect with a web browser). The dashboard enables checking running Prometheus configuration and testing the metrics collection.

For example, to observe the `stunner_listener_connections` metric on the Prometheus dashboard:

1. Write `stunner_listener_connections` to the marked field (next to the looking glass icon).
2. Click on the `Execute` button.
3. Switch to `Graph` view tab.

Note that some STUNner metrics may not be available when they are inactive (e.g., there is no active cluster).

To configure/check the Prometheus data source in Grafana, first click on *Configuration* (1), then *Data sources* (2), as shown here:

![Grafana Data Source Check Step 1](img/grafana-prom-datasource_0.png)

This will open up the datasources page. Scroll down to the bottom, click button *Save & test* (1), and observe the datasource is working (2):
