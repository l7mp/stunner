# Concepts

In this guide we describe STUNner's architecture and the most important components of an
operational STUNner installation.

## Architecture

A STUNner installation consists of two parts, a *control plane* and a *dataplane*. The control
plane consists of a set of declarative policies specifying the way WebRTC media should enter the
Kubernetes cluster and the way it should be routed across the media plane, plus a gateway-operator
that renders the high-level policies to an actual dataplane configuration. The dataplane itself is
responsible to deal with actual media packets, exposing a regular STUN/TURN server to the Internet
for clients to connect, authorizing and authenticating client traffic, running integrity checks,
and forwarding packets to the media servers over the private pod network, all based on the
configuration generated by the gateway-operator.
