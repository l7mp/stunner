# Concepts

In this guide we describe STUNner's architecture and the most important components of an
operational STUNner installation.

## Architecture

A STUNner installation consists of two parts, a *control plane* and a *dataplane*. The control
plane consists of declarative policies specifying the way WebRTC media traffic should enter the
Kubernetes cluster and the way it should be routed the media servers, plus a gateway-operator that
renders the high-level policies to an actual dataplane configuration. The dataplane itself consists
one or more `stunnerd` pods to deal with actual media packets. The `stunnerd` pod exposes a regular
STUN/TURN server for clients to connect and forwards client packets to the media servers over the
private pod network, all based on the configuration generated by the gateway-operator. Since the
TURN service underlying STUNner is agnostic to NATs, STUNner can ingest clients' media traffic into
the private Kubernetes pod network addressing all NAT traversals (client-side and server-side) in a
single go.

The unit of the STUNner configuration is a [designated Kubernetes
namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces) that holds
the control plane configuration and the dataplane pods. You can run multiple STUNner deployments
side-by-side by installing a separate control plane and dataplane into a each namespace (you must
still have only a single STUNner gateway-operator though). Currently there is no way to share
configuration (e.g., UDPRoutes) between different namespaces.

### Control plane

The STUNner control plane consists of the following components:

* **Gateway hierarchy:** A Gateway hierarchy is a collection of [Kubernetes Custom
Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources)
that together describe the way media traffic should enter the cluster, including public IP
addresses and ports clients can use to reach STUNner, TURN credentials, forwarding rules, etc. The
anchor of the Gateway hierarchy is the GatewayClass object, and the rest of the resources form a
complete hierarchy underneath it: the GatewayConfig describes static STUNner configuration,
Gateways define a public IP address, port and transport protocol for STUNner to open TURN servers,
and UDPRoutes describes the backend services client traffic should be forwarded to. See
[here](/doc/REFERENCE.md) for a full reference.

* **Gateway-operator service:** The main purpose of the gateway-operator is to watch Gateway
hierarchies for change and, once a custom resource is added or modified by the user, render a new
dataplane running configuration. This configuration is then mapped into the filesystem of the
`stunnerd` pods running in the same namespace, so that each `stunnerd` instance will use the most
recent configuration.

* **STUNner ConfigMap:** The STUNner ConfigMap contains the running dataplane configuration that
will be implemented by the dataplane pods. Of course, we could let the `stunnerd` pods themselves
watch the control plane configuration for changes, but this would run into scalability limitations
for large deployments. Instead, in Kubernetes we usually separate the control plane and the
dataplane, which brings lots of cool
[benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking). The STUNner ConfigMap is
usually named as `stunnerd-config`, but you can override this from the GatewayConfig.

## Dataplane

The STUNner dataplane is comprised of a fleet of `stunnerd` pods. These pods actually implement the
TURN server, using the configuration available in the STUNner ConfigMap which is mapped into the
pods' filesystem dynamically. Then, `stunnerd` will watch for changes in the config file and, once
a change is detected, it [reconciles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller)
the dataplane to match the new user policies.

The `stunnerd` daemon itself, which runs in the pods, is essentially a simple TURN server on top of
[pion/turn](https://github.com/pion/turn) written in Go. The daemon will instantiate a separate
*listener* for each Gateway in the Gateway hierarchy to terminate clients' TURN sessions, a
*cluster* per each UDPRoute to forward packets to the backend services (e.g., to the media
servers), plus some additional administrative and authentication mechanism to check client
credentials before admitting traffic into the cluster. You are free to scale the dataplane to as
many `stunnerd` pods as you like: Kubernetes will make sure to conveniently distribute client
connections over the pods.
