                    description: |-
                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                        MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                        spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                        MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will

                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                    minDomains:
                      description: |-
                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                        of pods into each bucket.
                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.

                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

          UDPRoute provides a way to route UDP traffic. When combined with a Gateway listener, it can be
          used to forward traffic on the port specified by the listener to a set of backends specified by
          the UDPRoute.

          Differences from Gateway API UDPRoutes
            - port-ranges are correctly handled ([port, endPort])

              parentRefs:
                description: |-
                  ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                  to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                  allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                  the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                  namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                  namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                  and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                  create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                  Route.

                  There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                  resources.

                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                  Some examples:

                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                    same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                    object must also set `port`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                  merged.

                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                  <gateway:experimental:description>
                  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                  routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                  any namespace to the Service.

                  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                  "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                  connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                  the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                  ParentRef of the Route.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:

                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.

                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                        any namespace to the Service.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                        ParentRef of the Route.

                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                        must match both specified values.

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,

                        Gateway, and why.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace

                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                            routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                            any namespace to the Service.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                            ParentRef of the Route.

                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
